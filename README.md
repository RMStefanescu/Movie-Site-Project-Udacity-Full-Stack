**Razvan's Top Movie Site Builder**

Is a Python application that dynamically generates a movie site containing my favourite films.
It has three types of scripts that are building the movie items: media_api.py- _movie info comes from The Movie Database API_, media_dynamic.py- _movies are generated from a pre-written txt file - movie_data.txt_ and finally media_static- _movie data is created inline in the code_.
